If a System Calls returns an error before the program start accepting connection, it should write in stderr "Fatal error" followed by a \n and exit with status 1
If you cant allocate memory it should write in stderr "Fatal error" followed by a \n and exit with status 1

Your program must be non-blocking but client can be lazy and if they don't read your message you must NOT disconnect them...

The fd that you will receive will already be set to make 'recv' or 'send' to block if select hasn't be called before calling them, but will not block otherwise. 

Memory or fd leaks are forbidden

To help you, you will find the file main.c with the beginning of a server and maybe some useful functions. (Beware this file use forbidden functions or write things that must not be there in your final program)

Warning our tester is expecting that you send the messages as fast as you can. Don't do un-necessary buffer.

Hint: To test you can use fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK) but use select and NEVER check EAGAIN (man 2 send)







Allowed functions:

1. socket
2. bind
3. listen
4. accept/5. select
6. recv
7. send
8. close
